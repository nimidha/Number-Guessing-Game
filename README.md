# Number-Guessing-Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in JavaScript.

# Game Description

The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The player is prompted to guess this number. The screen will display feedback based on the player's input:

    If the guess is higher than the random number, the program will display "Number is TOO high".
    If the guess is lower than the random number, the program will display "Number is Too low".
    If the guess matches the random number, the program will display "yey, correct" along with the number of attempts made.

The game continues until the player guesses the correct number. The total number of attempts made by the player is tracked and displayed at the end of the game.
